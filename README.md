## Practicing how to format and build .rst files with Sphinx

Inspiration from:
- [RStudio - RMarkdown Exercises](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/73285_9a3f47a31355411e91936b493bab29aa.html)

Some helpful .rst resources:
- [rst Cheatsheet](https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/rst-cheatsheet/rst-cheatsheet.html) from  GitHub user: `bashtage`
- [Sphinx - Directives](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html)
- [Docutils - rst syntax details](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html)

------ 
**Remember**: to build with Sphinx on Windows use `python -m sphinx . build` is the same directory that the .rst file is located.
